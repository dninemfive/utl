# utl - <ins>Ut</ins>i<ins>l</ins>ity Library
A library of all the code i find myself reusing in my miscellaneous projects, plus some fun stuff like a command-line argument parser.

Intended to be fully documented, but i'm not quite there yet. Maybe i'll auto-generate wiki docs from my XML docu-comments in the future.
